# Tokyo Bus Guide reversing

My attempt to reverse engineer the Sega Dreamcast game "Tokyo Bus Guide".

For now my goal is to understand the basics (main loop,menu, loading, gameplay), as this is my first Dreamcast RE project.
Most of source code is only meant to illustrate the original logic.

## Updates

Now that I have a basic understanding of the tasks systems and how the Main Menu works, let's try to grasp the course loading and gameplay.
